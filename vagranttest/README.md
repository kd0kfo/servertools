Vagrant VM Test
===============

To run the test on a vagrant deployed virtual box VM, simply run "vagrant up". This will test on a CentOS 6.5 VM with the minimum requirements to build the software and its dependencies.

If the BOINC git repository is cloned in this directory, the vagrant provision process will clone that repository. Otherwise, it will clone a BOINC mirror on github.
